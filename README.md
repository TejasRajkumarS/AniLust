## 📖 Deep Dive Overview
**AniLust** is more than just an anime tracker; it is a high-performance discovery engine built for the modern anime community. Developed with a focus on **Minimalist UX** and **Real-time Data Fetching**, it provides a centralized "Multiverse" hub to browse, search, and manage anime titles.

The application addresses the common issue of cluttered anime databases by offering a "Cinema-First" dark mode interface that emphasizes high-quality cover art and smooth transitions.

* **State Control:** Managed via native JavaScript to ensure a lightweight footprint without the overhead of heavy frameworks.
* **Visual Assets:** Uses dynamic rendering for cover images to ensure the UI remains fast while loading high-resolution media.
